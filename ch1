Lambok and his elder sister
Phiban live in Shillong. One day
they came home from school.
Their parents were away at
work and Lambok complained
that he was feeling feverish.
Phiban touched his forehead
and felt that he might be having
a fever. To confirm this, she
took out the thermometer kept
in the almirah. She washed
its tip with soap and water,
and measured Lambok’s
temperature. To her relief, she
found that his temperature
was normal. She washed the
thermometer tip again, dried

 Take three large containers and label them A, B and C,
as shown in Fig. 7.1.
 Pour warm water in container A, tap water in B and icecold water in C.

Compare whether your observations match with your

container B is cool, while your left hand felt that
the same water is warm? What do you infer
from these observations?
We cannot always rely upon our sense of
touch to decide correctly whether a body is
hot or cold.
7.2 Temperature
A reliable measure of hotness (or coldness) of a body is
its temperature. A hotter body has a higher temperature
than a colder body. The difference in temperature between
the two bodies tells us how hot a body is in comparison to
another body. A device that measures temperature is called
a thermometer.
There are two kinds of thermometers that you are
likely to come across—clinical thermometers and
laboratory thermometers. Clinical thermometers are used
to measure human body temperatures whereas laboratory
thermometers are used for many other purposes. Let us
now learn more about thermometers and how to use them
to measure temperature.
7.3 Measuring Temperature
7.3.1 Clinical thermometer
You might be familiar with a thermometer, like that shown in
Fig. 7.2, which is used for measuring our body temperature.
It is called a clinical thermometer. Such thermometers show
temperatures digitally. These are also known as digital
clinical thermometers and run on batteries. These measure

Earlier, mercury thermometers were used for measuring
the body temperature. But mercury is an extremely toxic
substance and is difficult to dispose of if the thermometer
breaks accidently.
Digital thermometers pose no such risk and also the
numbers in its display are easier to read. Therefore,
mercury thermometers are being replaced by digital
thermometers. Temperature in a digital thermometer
is determined with the help of heat sensors.
temperature when the thermometer is placed in contact
with a person’s body.
For measuring temperature, the clinical thermometers
generally use a scale called the Celsius scale. On this
scale, the unit of temperature is degree Celsius and is
denoted by °C.
They are non-contact thermometers,
also called infrared
thermometers. Such
thermometers can
measure temperature
without touching a
person’s body and
thus reduce the risk of
spreading disease.
During the COVID-19
pandemic, some special
thermometers were used,
which could measure the
temperature of a person
from a distance. What were
those?

Let us now use a digital clinical thermometer
to measure body temperature. You may
measure your own temperature as well as
the temperature of some of your friends.
Talk to your friends to find out who would
be willing to get their body temperatures
measured by you.
 Wash your hands and the tip of the
digital thermometer with soap and
water.
 Reset the thermometer by pressing the
reset button.
 Place the thermometer under the
tongue and close your mouth.
 Wait till the thermometer makes a
beeping sound or flashes a light.
 Take it out from the mouth and read
the temperature on the digital display.
 Record the temperature in Table 7.1.
 Clean the tip of the thermometer with soap and water,
and dry it.
 Repeat the above steps for measuring the temperatures
of your friends.

The normal temperature of a healthy human body is taken
to be 37.0 °C. But in this activity, did you find that the normal
temperature of every person was 37.0 °C? Or did you find the
temperature slightly higher or lower for some people?
The temperature of every person may not
be 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature
is the average body temperature of a large
number of healthy people. A perfectly
healthy person may, therefore, have a
normal temperature slightly different from
37.0 °C. The body temperature is influenced
by several factors, such as age, time of the
day and activity level.
You may try measuring your own
temperature at different times of the day and
on different days. Record the thermometer
readings in your notebook. After a month,
analyse your temperature record and see if
there are any variations. If yes, try to think
what might be the reasons for that.
The temperature of human beings does
not normally go below 35 °C or above 42 °C.
For measuring the body temperature
of small children or old people, the digital
thermometer can also be placed in the
armpit. The temperature measured this way
is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual
body temperature.
There is another scale of temperature
known as Fahrenheit scale. On this scale, the
unit of temperature is degreeFahrenheit and
is denoted by °F. A temperature measured as
37.0 °C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 °F
on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is
not used in most scientific studies anymore.
In scientific work, there is another scale of
temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this
scale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and
is denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature
is kelvin.
Do small children
generally have
slightly higher body
temperatures as
compared to adults?
?
Do old people, even
when healthy, generally
have lower body
temperatures than
young adults?
?
I have seen a friend of mine

The names of temperature scales—Celsius scale,
Fahrenheit scale and Kelvin scale—start with a capital
letter. For the units for temperature, degree Celsius and degree
Fahrenheit, the word degree starts with a lower-case letter while
Celsius and Fahrenheit start with a capital letter. The unit kelvin
starts with a lower-case letter. The symbols of all units (°C, °F, K) are
capital letters. Note that degree sign (°) is not written with K. A full
stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence.
While writing the temperature, a space is left between the number
and the unit. For temperatures more than one degree, use the plural
of ‘degree’, that is, ‘degrees’, while writing the full form of the unit.
We can easily convert the
temperature from Celsius scale to
Kelvin scale by using:
Temperature in Kelvin
scale = Temperature in
Celsius scale + 273.15

All three temperature
scales, Celsius, Fahrenheit
and Kelvin are named in

How was fever detected before
thermometers were developed? Fever
affects the pulse rate of a person. This
was known even in olden days
in India. However, apart from
fever, some other situations
also affect the pulse rate.
Hence, pulse rate alone is not
a reliable indicator of fever. Do you

7.3.2 Laboratory thermometer
There are many types of laboratory thermometers but the
one that might be available in your school laboratory may
look like the one shown in Fig. 7.3a. It consists of a long,
narrow, uniform glass tube which is sealed. At one end of
the tube is a bulb which contains a liquid. Outside the bulb,
in the tube, a narrow column of liquid can be seen. There
is a Celsius scale marked along the tube. The liquid column
rises or falls with change in temperature. The mark of the
Celsius scale with which the top level of the liquid column
coincides is the temperature reading.
The liquid used in the laboratory
thermometer is generally alcohol (coloured
red to make it easily seen) or mercury. Do you
know?

Let us now try to find the smallest value that a given
laboratory thermometer can read.
 Again, take the same laboratory thermometer which
you used in Activity 7.3 and observe it carefully.
 Note down the following:
— How much is the temperature difference indicated
between the two bigger marks?
— How many divisions (shown by smaller marks)
are there between these two bigger marks?
— How much temperature does one small division
indicate?
— So, the smallest value that the thermometer can
read is
Fig. 7.3b shows a closeup of a part of the thermometer
shown in Fig. 7.3a. Can you now find the smallest value that
this thermometer can read?
For the thermometer shown in Fig. 7.3b, the
temperature difference indicated between 0 °C and
10 °C or between 10 °C and 20 °C is 10 °C. And the
number of divisions between these marks are 10
divisions. So, one small division can read 10/10 = 1 °C.
That is, the smallest value that this thermometer
can read is 1 °C.
Your school laboratory may have thermometers
for which the range and the value of the smallest
division may be different. It is, therefore, always
necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you
are about to use.
You have learnt how to find the temperature range
of a given laboratory thermometer. You have
also learnt how to find the smallest value that a
given laboratory thermometer can read. We will
now learn how to measure temperature using a

 Observe the rise of liquid column in the thermometer.
Wait till the column stops rising and note the
temperature (do not wait too long; otherwise,
the water itself will start to cool).
What is the temperature of water
measured by you? Compare it with the
readings of your friends.
Do you notice that, as soon as you take the
thermometer out of the water, the level of liquid
column begins to fall?
This means that the temperature must be read
while the thermometer is immersed in water.
